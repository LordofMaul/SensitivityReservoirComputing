<h1>Sensitivity on Reservoir Computing wrt. training data</h1>
<h2>Generating Data by solving Hénon-Heiles-System</h2>
Hamiltonian given by:

```math
H=\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2+\dot x^2+\dot y^2)+x^2y-\frac{y^3}{3}
```
Solving using Runge-Kutta-4 method for certain sets of starting points to generate worse and better training datasets.
